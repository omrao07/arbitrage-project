METHODOLOGY NOTES — DATASETS FOR DAMODARAN BOT + HEDGE FUND PLATFORM
=====================================================================

1. BETAS
--------
- Raw betas are collected by sector from Damodaran's annual NYU update.
- Unlevered betas are calculated by removing the effect of leverage:
    Unlevered Beta = Levered Beta / [1 + (1 - Tax Rate) * (Debt/Equity)]
- Relevered betas are constructed using sector or regional average D/E ratios.
- Standard errors and R^2 values come from regressions vs. market indices.
- Curated files:
    - betas_by_sector.csv (latest snapshot, curated)
    - versions/{year}/betas.csv (historical snapshots)
    - bottom_up/by_sector.csv and bottom_up/by_region.csv for rolled-up estimates.

2. FUNDAMENTALS
---------------
- Built by aggregating income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow data.
