# backend/risk/contagion_graph.py
"""
Compatibility shim for the contagion graph module.

Your full implementation lives in `backend/risk/contagian_graph.py`
(typo kept for backward-compat). This file lets you import the same
classes with the correct spelling:

    from backend.risk.contagion_graph import ContagionGraph, Bank, ShockParams

If the underlying module isnâ€™t found, we raise a clear ImportError
with instructions.
