# shm/.gitkeep
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# This file exists only to keep the shm/ directory in version control.
# At runtime, the gateway will create shared memory objects under /dev/shm
# (POSIX shm_open) such as:
#   /risk_wall
#   /md_ringbuf
#   /orders_in
#   /fills_out
#   /heartbeat
#
# These appear in /dev/shm on Linux and should NOT be checked into git.
# Add to .gitignore:
#   shm/*.shm
#
# Safe to delete or leave empty â€” purpose is directory tracking.
