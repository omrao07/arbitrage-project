# 📚 Literacy Mode — Hedge Fund Platform

> **Purpose:**  
> Literacy Mode is the **educational & financial literacy companion** inside the hedge fund system.  
> It is designed to make advanced trading/risk concepts accessible to **students, retail investors, and NGOs**, while still running on the same professional-grade architecture.

- It uses the same data feeds, strategies, and risk modules as the hedge fund, but **translates outputs into plain English + visuals**.  
- Includes dashboards, tooltips, and “Explainable Trades” so anyone can **learn finance by seeing how a hedge fund would act**.

### 🔹 Explainable Trades
